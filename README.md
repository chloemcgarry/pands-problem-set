Problem are:

Problem 1 - Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number. File name problem1.py

Problem 2 - Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. An example of running this program on a Thursday is as follows. File name problem2.py

Problem 3 - Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12. File name problem3.py

Problem 4 - Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one. File name problem4.py

Problem 5 - Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime. File name problem5.py

Problem 6 - Write a program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word. File name problem6.py

Problem 7 - Write a program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. File name problem7.py

Problem 8 - Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format “Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”. File name problem8.py

Problem 9 - Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line. File name problem9.py

Problem 10 - Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x^2 and 2^x in the range [0, 4]. File name problem10.py
